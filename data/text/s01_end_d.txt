Mission 1: Destroy Weapons Caravan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dust settles on the battlefield, revealing acrid, smoking craters where once your proud
army stood. Dispite having the advantage of surprise, the enemy forces had you outnumbered
and outgunned, and proved to be far more cunning than you had given them credit for.

They made short work of your force, leaving no survivors and scavenging whatever useful
equipment they could from your remains before moving on.

Their ultimate destination can only be your homeland, and without you, your cities will have
no warning of the coming onslaught. They will fall as easily as you have.



Your people are doomed.
