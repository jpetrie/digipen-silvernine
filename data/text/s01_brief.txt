Mission 1: Destroy Weapons Caravan
----------------------------------------------

Units Allowed: 8

Our scouts have reported sightings of a small caravan travelling 
through our territory. The caravan is suspected to contain supplies 
and weapons plans recently stolen from our North Point research 
base.

The enemy is believed to be lightly armed, but numerous. Our latest 
report indicates a force of at least ten strong, piloting mechs of 
Grunt-class or below.

Since it has been more than three hours since our last scout reported 
in, we are unable to confirm the exact location of the enemy force. 
However, based on their last known heading, we expect them to be 
somewhere to the northeast of your current location.

Good luck.
