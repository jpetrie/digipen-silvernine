# Silver Nine

Silver Nine is a real-time strategy game heavily inspired by Bungie's Myth series. It was created between 2003 and
2004 by the Scientific Ninja team as part of our GAM200 and GAM250 project courses at
[DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://digipen.edu).

The game was written in C++ and featured a data-driven asset system that, like the game itself, drew heavy inspiration
from Myth's own tag system. The assets were created and edited using tool named Apathy, which was created in Borland's
C++ Builder. Silver Nine itself was built with Visual Studio. We used OpenGL for the graphics and FMOD
for the audio. Lua was used to implement the game's scripting functionality.

This repository is a mostly-complete copy of the final source code submission we turned in for the course. FMOD headers
and binaries have been removed, as has a DLL for the glaux library. The handful of sound files that we used have also
been excluded due to uncertainty regarding their copyright status.

The members of the Scientific Nina team who created the game were:
 - Eric Roberts
 - Jessica McCrory
 - Josh Petrie
 - Patrick Laukaitis
 - Scott Smith

DigiPen retains the copyright to the game and the contents of this repository. They have allowed the project to be 
preserved and updated here under a non-commercial license.
