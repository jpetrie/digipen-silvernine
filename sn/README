Perl Scripts
  Silver Nine relies on a handful of Perl scripts to generate some of its code. Most of these scripts are
  run as pre- or post-build steps; consequently you will not be able to compile the source unless you
  have a Perl interpreter installed. We suggest ActivePerl, available from www.activestate.com.
